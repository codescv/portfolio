title: NesGym
summary: NESGym was a personal project that I undertook after being captivated by the groundbreaking achievements of AlphaGo. The advent of Reinforcement Learning (RL) garnered significant attention in the machine learning community during that time. Notably, OpenAI introduced a gym environment to facilitate RL experimentation. As an avid Nintendo enthusiast, I found it intriguing to create an environment for the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) emulator as well.
